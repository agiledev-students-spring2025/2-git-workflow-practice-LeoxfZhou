# What I found interesting
The article discusses how AI-powered coding tools are revolutionizing software development. It lists several major AI assistants including Claude, Warp AI Terminal, GitHub Copilot, and ChatGPT-4 Mini. These tools help developers with various tasks like code completion and bug fixing.
I find it interesting because it highlights an important shift in how we approach software development. For decades, programming has been a purely human endeavor, requiring us to remember lots of commands, syntax rules, and needing lots of practice. Now, AI assistants are making developers more efficient and making code more accessible to newcomers. For example, I often ask AI about confusing terminal commands, as it saves me a lot of time.
